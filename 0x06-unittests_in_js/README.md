## Task

This project focuses on implementing unit tests for a backend application using JavaScript, particularly leveraging Mocha as the testing framework. As part of this task, you'll learn how to use different assertion libraries like Chai and Sinon, handle asynchronous functions, and write integration tests for a small Node.js server.

## Resources

Read or watch:
- [Mocha documentation](https://mochajs.org/)
- [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/)
- [Sinon](https://sinonjs.org/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)
- [How to Test NodeJS Apps using Mocha, Chai and SinonJS](https://www.sitepoint.com/promoted/test-node-js-with-mocha-chai-and-sinon/)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- How to use Mocha to write a test suite
- How to use different assertion libraries (Node or Chai)
- How to present long test suites
- When and how to use spies
- When and how to use stubs
- What are hooks and when to use them
- Unit testing with Async functions
- How to write integration tests with a small node server

## Requirements

- All of your code will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 using Node 12.x.x
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the js extension
- When running every test with `npm run test *.test.js`, everything should pass correctly without any warning
